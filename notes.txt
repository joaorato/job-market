//IMMEDIATE TODO

- death():
    . health chance: introduce exponential like in happiness
    . happiness chance (tweak values)

- introduce some visuals:
    . layout of the main page: font, space between buttons/text
    . drawings for life stages    
    . work on a prototype design

- rethink the code structure and overall design:
    . new classes/scripts
    . timePassing() alternatives/changes
    . future design

- tweak attributes:
    . work gives too little money - scale to real values
    . make study more expensive for adults
    . tweak relax cost (maybe it's okay after work is fixed)

//FUTURE ENDEAVOURS

introduce subdivisions for the actions: locked if attributes dont match

special choices in certain ages

introducing health: not just stress

doctor: increases health. spending a lot of time without going there will increase probability of disease

random events that help increase happiness, reduce stress etc.

therapy

spend money/experience(?) to gain skills -> skill tree?
